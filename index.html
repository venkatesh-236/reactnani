<p>To push code to Github, follow these steps:

   1) Create a Github repository or select an existing one.
    
    2)Clone the repository to your local machine using the Git CLI or a Git client like Sourcetree.
    
    3)Navigate to the local repository on your machine using the terminal/command line.
    
    4)Make changes to the files in your local repository.
    
    5)Stage the changes using the command git add . (or specify the specific file(s) you want to stage).
    
    6)Commit the changes using the command git commit -m "commit message" where "commit message" is a brief description of the changes you made.
    
  7)Push the changes to Github using the command git push origin master (assuming you want to push to the "master" branch).
    
    8)Your code will now be available on Github and can be viewed by others who have access to the repository.</p>
